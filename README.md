, Gradle (Multiple-Modules-Build), mybatisPlus (multiple, dynamic data source), OAuth2.0 authorization service (SaaS Enterprise Edition), WeChat applet, etc.
The project also integrates middleware and automated build deployment technologies such as Redis, MQ, and Jenkin deployment.
It is a complete enterprise-level SOA architecture, which can be used by enterprise users. A set of frameworks that beginners can master step by step [continuous support]
